* **Ragie:** Enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate responses.
* **Scrapy:** Gathers documents for the knowledge base through web scraping.
* **Replit:** Hosts the code in a cloud-based environment.
## 2. Setup Instructions
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up, running, and deploying the chatbot.  

#### Prerequisites:
Ensure your environment meets the following requirements:  
- **Python Version**: `>=3.11`  
- **Dependencies**:  
  ```text
  flask-cors==5.0.0
  flask>=3.1.0
  openai==1.57.0
  requests==2.32.3
  Scrapy==2.12.0
  ```
The recommended IDE for development and testing is Replit.
#### Installation Steps
* Install Python 3.11 or later if not already installed.
* Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* if ```requirements.txt``` is not available, manually install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install flask-cors==5.0.0 flask>=3.1.0 openai==1.57.0 requests==2.32.3 Scrapy==2.12.0
    ```
#### Running the Chatbot Locally
##### Run the Web Crawler
Navigate to the ```crawler``` directory and start the Scrapy crawler:
```bash
cd crawler
scrapy crawl norse_spider
```
This will crawl the website and save content in the ```crawled_pages``` subdirectory.
##### Upload Data to Ragie
* Upload the ```crawled_pages``` folder to Google Drive.
* Create an account on Ragie.ai.
* Link the ```crawled_pages``` folder from Google Drive to your Ragie account.
##### Configure Voiceflow for Chatbot UI
* Create a free account on [Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com/).
* Upload the ```.vf``` file from the ```voiceflow``` directory.
* Open the project and navigate to the workflow section.
* Click "Edit Workflow", update the following URLs:
    * "Create Thread": Change URL to your APIâ€™s ```/start``` endpoint.
    * "Generate Response": Change URL to your APIâ€™s ```/chat``` endpoint.
* Publish the workflow to get the HTML UI component for embedding it in your html page.
##### Set Up OpenAI Assistants
* Create two assistants in OpenAI Dashboard.
* Configure them using instructions from the ```instructions``` directory.
* For the evaluator assistant, set response format to ```json_schema```.
* Copy and paste the content from ```instructions/evaluator/response_format.json```.
* Save the Assistant IDs for later configuration.
##### Configure Environment Secrets
Before running the application, set up the required environment secrets:
```bash
export APP_SECRET="<Some long random unpredictable string which is used to sign cookies securely>"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<Your OpenAI API key>"
export MAIN_ASSISTANT="<ID of the main assistant>"
export EVALUATOR_ASSISTANT="<ID of the evaluator assistant>"
```
For Replit, add these secrets in the Secrets Manager.
##### Start the Chatbot
Run the chatbot server:
```bash
python main.py
```
If all steps are followed correctly, the chatbot should be up and running! ðŸŽ‰





## 3. Approach & Methodology
## 4. Content Safety Implementation
To ensure a safe and appropriate user experience, the chatbot employs a robust content filtering system that detects and manages unsafe or out-of-scope queries. This system follows predefined rules and heuristics to identify sensitive topics and respond appropriately.  

---

#### Filtering Unsafe Content  

The chatbot strictly avoids answering questions related to the following sensitive topics:  

##### 1. Religious Content  
- **Example:** `"Can you help me decide which religion to follow?"`  
- **Response:** `"I'm sorry, but I can't provide guidance on religious matters."`  

##### 2. Political Discussions  
- **Example:** `"What are your political views on [current issue]?"`  
- **Response:** `"I can't discuss political topics, but I can help with other inquiries!"`  

##### 3. Illegal Activities  
- **Example:** `"How can I hack into a website?"`  
- **Response:** `"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with illegal activities."`  

##### 4. Personal Advice  
- **Example:** `"I'm feeling depressed; what should I do?"`  
- **Response:** `"I'm not qualified to provide personal advice. If you're struggling, I recommend speaking with a trusted professional or support organization."`  

##### 5. Unethical Requests  
- **Example:** `"How can I avoid paying taxes?"`  
- **Response:** `"I'm unable to provide assistance with unethical or illegal matters."`  

Whenever a user asks about these topics, the chatbot politely refuses to answer while maintaining a respectful and professional tone.  

---

#### Handling Out-of-Scope Topics  

The chatbot's expertise is limited to **Norse mythology**. If a user inquires about unrelated mythologies or topics outside this scope, the chatbot provides a polite refusal:  

- **Example Prompt:** `"Can you tell me about Greek mythology?"`  
- **Response:** `"I'm only knowledgeable about Norse mythology. If you have questions about Odin, Thor, or Ragnarok, I'd be happy to help!"`  

This ensures that the chatbot stays within its intended domain and delivers accurate, relevant responses.

By enforcing these filtering mechanisms, the chatbot maintains a safe, ethical, and focused conversational experience for users.
