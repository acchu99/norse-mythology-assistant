Sleipnir - Norse Mythology for Smart People
Sleipnir (pronounced “SLAYP-nir”; Old Norse Sleipnir , “The Sliding One”) is the eight-legged horse of the god Odin . Sleipnir is one of Odin’s many shamanic helping spirits, ranks that also include the valkyries and Hugin and Munin , and he can probably be classified as a fylgja . Odin rides Sleipnir on his frequent journeys throughout the Nine Worlds , which are held in the branches and roots of the world-tree Yggdrasil .
The eight-legged horse as a means of transportation used by shamans in their ecstatic travels throughout the cosmos is a motif that can be found in a staggering number of indigenous traditions from all over the world. Sleipnir is “the shamanic horse par excellence ,” [1] just as Odin is the shamanic god par excellence .
Sleipnir was born when the god Loki shape-shifted into a mare and became pregnant by the stallion of a giant , as is recounted in the tale of The Fortification of Asgard .
