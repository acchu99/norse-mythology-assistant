Surt - Norse Mythology for Smart People
Surt ( Old Norse Surtr , “Black,” [1] presumably a reference to his charred appearance) is a fire giant who leads his kin into battle against the Aesir and Vanir gods during Ragnarok , the destruction of the cosmos . His particular fate is to kill the god Freyr and to be slain by him in turn. He arrives from Muspelheim , the extreme southern region of heat and fire, bearing his weapon of choice of a burning sword, with which the world is razed before it sinks into the sea. [2] [3] [4]
Historian Rudolf Simek has proposed that Surt is the supernatural force who corresponds to “the (volcanic) fire of the Underworld,” [5] a personage who would surely have had a profound emotional resonance for any early Icelander, given the sheer amount of volcanic activity that characterizes that island.
