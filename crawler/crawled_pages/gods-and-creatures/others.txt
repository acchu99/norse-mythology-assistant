Others - Norse Mythology for Smart People
Some characters in Norse mythology donâ€™t fit into any of the established categories of beings that populate these tales ( Aesir and Vanir deities, giants , elves , etc.), or their affiliations with such groups are ambiguous or unknown due to the fragmentary nature of the sources we have concerning the mythology and religion of the pre-Christian Norse and other Germanic peoples. Such beings include the Norns , who create the fate of all beings; Mimir , an exceedingly wise being who is either an Aesir god or a giant; and Sleipnir and Hugin and Munin , three of the numerous familiar spirits of the god Odin .
