The Love of Destiny - Norse Mythology for Smart People

The Love of Destiny: The Sacred and the Profane in Germanic Polytheism is a short book I published in 2013 about the ancient Norse/Germanic worldview as I understood it at the time. It attempts to peer behind the mythology and religion, and to articulate the underlying ideas as a coherent and compelling philosophy. The writing style is quite bold and unconventional – somewhere between a scholarly essay and a prose poem – which some people have liked and some people haven’t. In hindsight, I got some things wrong, but I also got a lot of things right. Many people have found The Love of Destiny to be inspiring and illuminating, as the reviews on Amazon.com demonstrate. Perhaps you would, too.
