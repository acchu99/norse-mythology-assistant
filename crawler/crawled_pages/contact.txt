Contact - Norse Mythology for Smart People
Since I’ve ended my work on this site , I’m no longer answering emails. The one exception I’ll probably make is for publishers who are interested in publishing a translation of The Viking Spirit so that people can read it in other languages besides English.
My email address is dan @ this site’s domain name.
